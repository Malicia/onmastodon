Contributions are welcome!

Here is some advices.

## Adding Profiles

### Rules

Listed profiles must:

 +  Have at least 100,000 follower on Twitter or 500 on Mastodon.
 +  Be active, almost as their Twitter counterparts, if any.
 +  Mention if they are bot.

In case several bots for the same entity are available on different instances, you might list several.

By defaults, things should be alphabetically or randomly organised.

### Yaml Files

**TODO**

### Your pull request

 + You should make per-profile pull-request (PR): if your PR is rejected for one profile, the others are not excluded.
 + You might mention your mastodon account.
